Description: Three functions Psi_1, Psi_2_Psi_3 and SCI_Crossed are included to this package. The functions Psi_1 and Psi_2_Psi_3 are designed for obtaining the test statistic values, critical values and the P-values of the tests Psi1, Psi2 and Psi3. The function SCI_Crossed gives the lower limits of the one sided SCIs of the successive differences of the simple row and column effects.
